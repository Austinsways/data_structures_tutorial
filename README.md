# Data Structure Tutorial

Introduction:
Relevance of Data structures
The reasons to use more than just a list/array (efficiency and Big O Notation)

# Queue:
    Applications: When would we use a Queue?
    O Efficiencies/strengths of a queue
    Queuing 
    Dequeuing
    Example:
        An example showing a queue of people in line for ordering pizza from a restaurant
    Sample Problem:
        Using a queue to take calls in a customer service center

# Set:
    Applications: When would we use a set?
    O Efficiencies/strengths of a Set
    Adding to a set (no duplicates)
    Accessing an element in a set
    Hashes and an elements hash value
    Example:
        Unique words used in a given text
    Sample Problem:
        Using a set to figure out which individuals have visited a website 

# Tree
    Applications: When would we use a Binary Search Tree (BST)?
    O Efficiencies/strengths of a BST
    Adding to a BST
    Required organization of a BST (ordered)
    Nodes
    Root component
    Example:
        Using a BST to hold data/ creating a BST
    Sample Problem:
        Using a BST to hold and easily access an array of sorted numbers
